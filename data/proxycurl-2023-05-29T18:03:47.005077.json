    "Barry Mulling\n\n\n\nI consider Rod to be one of my biggest role models in the business. Working with Rod taught me a great deal about how to think about large-scale engineering problems, how to implement them, and how to promote a healthy, vibrant engineering culture. He enthusiastically shared his knowledge and skills and made everyone who worked with him better engineers and technologists. He has enough in-depth knowledge and experience to have strong opinions, but with a sense of practicality and balance that ensures that the perfect isn't the enemy of the good. If I'm half as good as Rod ten years from now I'll consider myself a raging success.",
    "Rudi Cilibrasi\n\n\n\nRod Morison achieves the rare combination of technical brilliance and\r\ninspirational management style.  He is able to code with ingenuity in\r\nall the languages his team needs, and can thus pick up the slack\r\nwherever his team needs help without overextending himself.  But he is\r\nalso able to delegate effectively, utilizing the special capability of\r\neach of his reports to the fullest extent and according to their\r\nworking style.  He is efficient with self-managing developers yet\r\nprovides ample direction for those that need more guidance.  He is\r\nperfectly comfortable designing great software architecture and\r\nutilizing the latest scientific literature for complex algorithm\r\ndevelopment.  He does all this within the context of critical business\r\npriorities and schedules and his track record shows it.  You can rely\r\non Rod to build and manage a team to get the job done right.",
    "Tom Longson\n\n\n\nRod is a good manager, not only because he knows how to keep a team moving forward, but also isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and dig into serious codebase. I only worked under Rod for a brief period, but I appreciated his professionalism and believe he is a strong asset to any tech shop.",
    "Diego Dugatkin\n\n\n\nRod did a great job at Ixia, successfully managing the development of the highly complex IxOS operating system and its directly associated products.  His ability to communicate clearly, together with very strong technical and organizational skills were essential for the several product releases during Rod's tenure.\r\nRod's breath and depth are a true asset for any engineering organization.",
    "Myron A.\n\n\n\nRod is a smart manager, very techically capable and a pleasure to work with.  We had many great brainstorming sessions to improve the product, and Rod always had good ideas. I'd highly recommend Rod for either a software development management/executive position or a hands-on development position.",
    "Bo Adler\n\n\n\nRod did an amazing job at bringing to life what seemed like an impossible task!  Pulling together developers from across the country, he worked with each one on the hurdles of how the technology might work.  Final integration of our pieces was a breeze as well, a credit to Rod's involvement at just the right level to keep things moving at a brisk pace."
